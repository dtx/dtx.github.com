[{"content": "I am currently an undergrad in Computer Science at University of Illinois, Urbana Champaign. I play with technology because I am passionate about it, I code because I like solving problems, I read because it makes me think. I strive to make my life simpler everyday with the knowledge I posess, and I love to learn more and more everyday, and I dont see an end to this, yet."}]
