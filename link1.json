[{"content": "I currently architect and build cloud and platforms in the Silicon Valley, I do so because it involves tackling complex technical issues with business insights no other layer in technology gives you. Outside work, I work on any part of the stack I please. An University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign alumni who strives to be the next generation of technocrats who are also capable of tackling business problems, I play with technology because I am passionate about it, I code because I like solving problems, I read because it makes me think. I strive to make my life simpler everyday with the knowledge I posess, and I love to learn more and more everyday, and I dont see an end to this, yet."}]
